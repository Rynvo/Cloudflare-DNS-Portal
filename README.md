## Background
Many of our Rynvo clients require a streamlined solution to manage their DNS settings without the complexities of a full DNS service. Our custom DNS Manager addresses this by:
- **Simplifying DNS Management:** Allowing clients to update and manage their DNS zones easily.
- **Enhancing Security:** Limiting access to only the necessary DNS zones and operations.
- **Improving User Experience:** Offering a modern, intuitive interface for seamless management.


## Key Features

- **Cloudflare API Integration:**  
  Connects to our Cloudflare account to manage client DNS zones while enforcing strict permission boundaries, ensuring clients only access what they need.

- **Granular Permission Controls:**  
  Custom-tailored permission settings prevent overreach, maintaining the security and integrity of our clients' DNS configurations.

- **Modern Front-End:**  
  Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** to deliver a responsive and engaging user experience.

- **Passwordless Authentication:**  
  Utilizes **Supabase** with magic links, allowing for seamless, no-password login. This not only improves security but also enhances user convenience.

- **Robust Back-End Infrastructure:**  
  Powered by Supabase, our back-end handles both authentication and data storage securely and efficiently.

## Architecture

### Front-End
- **React & Tailwind CSS:**  
  The client-facing application is built with React to provide a dynamic interface, while Tailwind CSS ensures a clean and responsive design.

### Back-End & Authentication
- **Supabase:**  
  Serves as our authentication and database platform. By leveraging magic links, users enjoy a streamlined, passwordless authentication process.

### DNS Management
- **Cloudflare API:**  
  Integrates directly with Cloudflare to manage DNS zones, applying strict permissions to ensure that each client only has access to their own DNS records.
